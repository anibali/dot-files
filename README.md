dismal_denizen's "dot" files
============================

This repository contains a few configuration files which I use to keep programs
pretty and and useful. You can run
[homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) to apply these
settings, or you can simply copy bits and pieces to incoorporate in your setup.

Just remember: these settings work on my computer with the software I have
installed. What works with my sytem may not work with yours, so make sure
that you back up your previous configuration.
