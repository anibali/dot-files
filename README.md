dismal_denizen's "dot" files
============================

This repository contains a few configuration files which I use to keep programs
pretty and useful. You can run
[homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) to apply these
settings, or you can simply copy bits and pieces to incorporate in your setup.

Just remember: these settings work on my computer with the software that I have
installed. What works with my system may not work with yours, so make sure
that you back up your previous settings before adopting any of these files.
